# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This project is a solution to the Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator project from the Data Analysis with Python course offered by freeCodeCamp.

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to create a function named `calculate()` in `mean_var_std.py` that utilizes NumPy to compute and output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3x3 matrix.

## Function Requirements

1. The function should be named `calculate()`.
2. It should accept a list containing 9 digits as input.
3. The function should convert the input list into a 3x3 NumPy array.
4. It should return a dictionary containing:
   - Mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes.
   - Mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum for the flattened matrix.

## Usage

To use the function, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the project files.
4. Run the `mean_var_std.py` script using Python:
5. Provide a list containing 9 digits as input when prompted.
6. The script will output the calculated mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum for the specified matrix.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- NumPy

Ensure that you have NumPy installed. You can install it via pip:
